              <p class="section-subtitle">
                A school is more than exams and grades. It’s a place where every student deserves to feel safe enough to
                be themselves.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p style="font-size:0.9rem; margin-bottom:8px;">
              This platform is built on a simple belief:
              <strong>silence should never be the only option.</strong>
              Many students never report bullying because they are afraid of not being believed, of retaliation,
              or of nothing changing.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:0.9rem; margin-bottom:8px;">
              By combining <strong>blockchain</strong> and <strong>AI-assisted review</strong>, we give schools a tool
              that is:
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:0.86rem; color:var(--text-muted); margin-bottom:8px;">
              <span class="chip">Honest – records can’t quietly vanish.</span><br>
              <span class="chip">Transparent – each decision is timestamped.</span><br>
              <span class="chip">Student-centered – built around safety and respect.</span>
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:0.9rem;">
              <em>“You are not overreacting. You are not the problem. Your safety matters.”</em><br>
              This system exists to turn that belief into action.
